The test will be on NestJS 10.3.3 with Fastify, a PostgreSQL DB, and TypeORM.
Read all until the end, that could help you understand the objective and how to do it better!

Your project should be able to:

1. Create a User like this:
- id
- first name
- last name
- email (2 Users with the same email can't be created)
- password (donâ€™t lose time with encryption)

2. Get the information of this User (all information except password)

3. Update this User information (except the email and ID, which should not be able to be edited)

4. Create Boats with those data:
- id
- name
- length
- width

5. Boats should be linked to 1 and only 1 User

6. Get all Boats of 1 User

7. Create Engines with those data:
- id
- power
- model
- maker

8. Engines are linked to a Boat and can only be fetched, created, updated, or deleted from the Boat in cascade

9. (BONUS) You can make the documentation with Swagger


! Don't do things that are not asked (ex: update a boat) you will lose time for no purpose !

Good Luck!
